# Notes
- Use test first programming, writing tests for every element of the code and making sure it works before progressing.
- Do not repeat yourself when programming. Encapsulate code appropriately.
- Make sure code is neat, commented and maintainable.
- Use a virtual environment (in .venv).
- For your own tests, use a mockup for logging in, but ensure that proper logging in (via lichess SSO) will work.
- You can add additional context or instructions for yourself in a REFLECTION.md file which you should read regularly.
